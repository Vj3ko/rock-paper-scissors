## Overview

This Rock, Paper, Scissors game allows players to play against the computer. There are two difficulty modes available:

- Easy mode, which is the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
- Hard mode, which is an expanded version called Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock that was created by [Sam Kass and Karen Bryla](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock).

The game also includes music and sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience. The score and selected difficulty are saved as localStorage values, allowing players to retain their progress and preferred difficulty even if they close the app and come back to it later.

### Rules
